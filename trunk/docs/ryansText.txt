In addition to the performance of the system for doing the rainbow table lookup.  The rainbow table load time should be taken into account.  In this system, the rainbow table is 40 GB in size.  With eight worker nodes, each node must load 5 GB of data into memory.  This is a time consuming and very serial process.  We found that it could take anywhere from 2 to 6 minutes for a single worker node to read its designated portion of the rainbow table.  Although this process is time consuming, it only needs to be performed once.
