struct rainbow_table_record {
    uint8_t rec_size;
    char *passphrase;
    uint8_t pmk[32];
} __attribute__ ((packed));

Figure x: struct for rainbow table record

Note that this structure is packed so that we can be sure of the byte alignment.  This is important so that we can read through the rainbow table efficiently.
