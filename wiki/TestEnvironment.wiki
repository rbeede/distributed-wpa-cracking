This test environment was provided by Cisco.  They loaned a machine and hosted it in their Boulder office data center.  It will be available from Feb 2011 until May 2011.

Rodney Beede is an intern for Cisco until May 2011.

= Hardware =

Cisco UCS C210 M1 General-Purpose Rack-Mount Server with 64GB of ram and two quad core Intel Xeon processors (8 logical cores).

16 137GB SAS drives for a total of 2,192GB of disk space configured in a single RAID5.

6 Gigabit Ethernet cards.  Only two are connected.

1 ILO Ethernet card, connected.

= Host Operating System =

VMware vSphere HypervisorTM (ESXi) 4.1

= Virtual Machines =

There are 9 total VMs.  All are on a private network.  Only 1 is on the public Internet.  You SSH into this machine which serves as an access point and job task manager.  You don't run actual jobs on this node since it is smaller than the others.  It is used to ssh onto other machines.

Ubuntu Server 64-bit 10.10 is used for each VM.

198.41.9.???:22 is the SSH access for this machine.  It has a private network address of TODO.

Node workers are in the private network range specified in the [#Networking] section.

Your home directory is shared among all virtual machines.  Your login username is the same across all, but your password is not synchronized.  It is recommended to setup ssh key pairs in your home directory for access to other machines.

Contact Rodney Beede if you need your SSH key and login.
