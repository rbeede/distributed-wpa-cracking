= 2011-02-23 20:41 - Rodney Beede - Got the project wiki and hosting up =

I managed to get a Google Code project hosting space setup with the wiki for tracking our progress on this class project.  We'll use the svn repository for storing our code.  It has a 4GB size limit which should be big enough to even hold the virtual machine running http://www.backtrack-linux.org/

= 2011-02-23 20:46 - Rodney Beede - Cisco hardware for the cluster =

This is taking longer than I would have liked.  The machine is setup with the OS, but Cisco is taking a long time to get a public Internet IP address for the machine.  I hope to have it by this Friday.
